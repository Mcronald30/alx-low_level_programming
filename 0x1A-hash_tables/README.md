0x1A-hash_tables
Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are a popular data structure used to implement
associative arrays or key-value pairs in programming languages like C.
They provide efficient access to data by using a hash function to map keys to
array indices, allowing for constant-time average case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.
